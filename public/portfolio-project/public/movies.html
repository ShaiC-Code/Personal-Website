<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider-Man 1</h3>
<p>The one with Toby Maguire, he plays a perfect Spider-Man</p>
<h3>Venom</h3>
<p>I saw it recently and enjoyed it</p>
<h3>The Grudge</h3>
<p>I was young when I watched it so I don't remeber it too well, but I remember it being a good scary movie</p>
